### Reporting sighting/defect
When submitting a defect report it is advised to provide all the relevant
information to reproduce the issue. This ideally includes:
- SW configuration, such as: Linux distribution version, Linux kernel version.
- Steps to reproduce (e.g. simple script with indication of failing steps).

<a id="feature_request"></a>

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome! Don't hesitate to submit a pull request! Patch
submission requirements:

- Contributions are accepted on BSD-3-Clause license.
- All patches must be signed off by the developer, which indicates that
submitter agrees to the Developer Certificate of Origin ([DCO](https://developercertificate.org/)).
- Commits must conform to [OCTF coding standard](https://github.com/Open-CAS/open-cas-telemetry-framework/blob/master/doc/coding_style/CODING_STYLE.md).
- Commits should build and pass tests.
- Commits should contain a clear message describing purpose of the commit (e.g.
bug fix, improvement, etc.). Ideal commit description should provide information
on why change is needed (e.g. what problem is being solved) and how this change
solves the problem.

Example commit with title, description and signoff information:

~~~{.sh}

### Typical flow for introducing changes

Usually development starts with cloning and checking out recent 'master' branch,
where you will start introducing your changes. To create a new local branch
named 'my_changes', based off 'origin/master' branch run following command.

~~~{.sh}
git fetch
git checkout -b my_changes origin/master
~~~

Introduce changes to the desired files and commit changes to the local
repository. Edit commit title and description. Common practices to maintain
good commit description is to adhere to following rules:

1. Separate commit title from description.
2. Commit title message should be short (less than 50 characters) and should
summarize the change. Start title with capital letter, do not end with a period.
3. Longer commit description should come after title and should be separated
with single a blank line. Message should wrap at 72 characters and provide
description for the change explaining what, why, how.
4. Make sure that your name and email address for author and signoff sections
are correct.

~~~{.sh}
# Stage files for commit
git add example_file.txt

# Commit files locally
git commit --signoff
~~~

Finally push the branch containing changes to the remote repository and open new
pull request on the github.

~~~{.sh}
git push my_changes origin
~~~
